This document describes the plan for the virtual conference sessions for AKBC 2020.

## General Structure

The main portal for the conference will be hosted at [http://akbc.ws/virtual](http://akbc.ws/virtual), accessible only to registrered attendees (not available yet). We will be relying on the following:

- [Rocket.chat](http://rocket.chat), for Slack-like functionality, embedded in the website
- [Zoom](http://zoom.us) meetings and webinars, for hosting all live sessions
- Pre-recorded videos and slides, on the website
- (optionally) [Sli.do](http://sli.do) for the live QA.

## Primary Conference Sessions + Invited Talks

We will have a live video stream, containing the opening/closing remarks, invited talks, and the streaming of the lightning talks. 
- We will be using a Zoom Webinar for this purpose, with the URL available only to registered attendees (and embedded on the page). 
- Attendees will able to chat during the talk (using Rocket.chat)
- Attendees will be able to ask/vote on questions for the speakers (using in-built Zoom webinar functionality or Sli.do). 
- The video will be also be recorded and available for offline viewing.

All the invited speakers will be presenting live. They will receive a link to Zoom webinar that they will join before their scheduled time.

## Papers

Each paper will have a dedicated page, containing the following:

- Pre-recorded video and slides.
- A channel in chat dedicated to the paper, which will be enabled and live during the whole conference (the authors are encouraged to check their paper's channel regularly).
- Links to PDF, reviews, etc.

### Recorded Lightning Talks

Each paper accepted to AKBC needs to present a short talk on the work. This video, along with slides, will be available on the website before the conference, but will also be streamed live during the corresponding lightning talks session.

Questions/comments regarding individual papers can be posted their corresponding chat channels.

### Live Session

Authors of each paper will participate in a _live_ poster session, where the authors will be available for discussions.
- These meetings will be held on Zoom, with the authors as the host.
- The attendees will be able to join the Zoom meetings from the paper's page.
- Apart from the chat channel, there will be no separate QA functionality.

## Sponsors

Each sponsor will get a dedicated page, with a chat channel and Zoom meeting link, if they are inclined to use them. The dedicated page can be used for company description, job openings, and contact information, and optionally for embedded chat and Zoom time+information (if the company is using it).

## Workshops

Similarly, each workshop will get a dedicated page, containing the overall description of the workshop. Each workshop will also have a dedicated chat channel, Sli.do embed, and a Zoom _meeting_, that the organizers are free to use as they like.
