### May 22, Day 3

#### Morning: 8:30am - 12pm
* [Scientific Literature Knowledge Bases](https://sites.google.com/view/akbc-sci/home) - Old Chapel, Great Hall<br>
  Keith Hall (Google), Waleed Ammar (AI2), Zack Ives (UPenn), Hoifung Poon (MSR), Karin Verspoor (U Melbourne)<br>
  **Invited speakers:** Iris Shen (Microsoft Research), Dina Demner-Fushman (NLM/NIH), Lucy Wang (AI2), Julia Lane (New York University) <br>
  *Goal:* explore the development and use of knowledge bases which capture important findings found in the scientific literature, and bring together researchers from diverse fields who are interested in the development of Scientific Literature KBs.

* [Knowledge Bases and Multiple Modalities](https://kb-mm.github.io/) - Integrated Learning Center (ILC) room S231<br>

  **Invited speakers:** Xinlei Chen (Facebook), Jared Dunnmon (Stanford University), Xiang Ren (USC)<br>
  *Goal:* bring together researchers interested in (a) combining knowledge bases with other modalities to showcase more effective downstream tasks, (b) improving completion and construction of knowledge bases from multiple modalities, and in general, to share state-of-the-art approaches, best practices, and future directions.

#### Afternoon: 1:30pm - 5pm
