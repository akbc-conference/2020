*Deadline: 18 December 2019*

Knowledge gathering, representation, and reasoning are among the fundamental challenges of artificial intelligence. Large-scale repositories of knowledge about entities, relations, and their abstractions are known as “knowledge bases”. Most major technology companies now have substantial efforts in knowledge base construction, and related scholarly work spans many research areas, including machine learning, natural language processing, computer vision, information integration, databases, search, data mining, knowledge representation, human computation, human-computer interfaces, and fairness. The AKBC conference serves as a research forum for all these areas, in both academia and industry.

There are also vibrant areas that involve either specialized knowledge base construction (e.g., scientific literature), or the intersection between knowledge base construction and other areas (e.g., trust, benchmarking, security).  We are soliciting proposals for half-day workshops at AKBC 2020 that connect Automated Knowledge Base Construction with these and other areas of computer science.

Proposals for Workshops should be submitted via email to [workshops@akbc.ws](mailto:workshops.akbc.ws) by 18 December 2019 and include:

- The title of the workshop.
- A half-page description of the workshop goals, themes, and topics.
- The format of the workshop -- how many keynote speakers, invited papers, papers or abstracts from an open call, panels, etc.
- As appropriate:
    - Ideas for potential keynote speakers who will help frame the workshop, and tentative submitters.
    - Ideas for panel and discussion topics or similar activities.
- Suggested members for a program committee.
