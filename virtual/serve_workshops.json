[{"UID":"kbmm","abstract":"<p>Recently, there has been growing interest in combining knowledge bases and multiple modalities such as NLP, vision and speech. These combinations have resulted in improvements to various downstream tasks including question answering, image classification, object detection, and link prediction.

In the past decade, extensive research efforts have gone into constructing and utilizing knowledge graphs for tasks in natural language processing, information retrieval, recommender systems, and more. Once constructed, knowledge graphs are often considered as \u201cgold standard\u201d data sources that safeguard the correctness of other systems. Because the biases inherent to KGs may become magnified and spread through such systems, it is crucial that we acknowledge and address various types of bias in knowledge graph construction.</p> <p>Such biases may originate in the very design of the KG, in the source data from which it is created (semi-)automatically, and in the algorithms used to sample, aggregate, and process that data. Causes of bias include systematic errors due to selecting non-random items (selection bias), misremembering certain events (recall bias), and interpreting facts in a way that affirms individuals\u2019 preconceptions (confirmation bias). Biases typically appear subliminally in expressions, utterances, and text in general and can carry over into downstream representations such as embeddings and knowledge graphs.</p> <p>This workshop \u2013 to be held for the first time at AKBC 2020 \u2013 addresses the questions: \u201chow do such biases originate?\u201d, \u201cHow do we identify them?\u201d, and \u201cWhat is the appropriate way to handle them, if at all?\u201d.
